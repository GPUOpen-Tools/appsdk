/*! \brief Retrieves the kernel information.
 *
 *  \param kernel specifies the kernel object being queried.
 *
 *  \param device identifies a specific device in the list of devices associated
 *  with \a kernel. The list of devices is the list of devices in the OpenCL
 *  context that is associated with \a kernel. If the list of devices associated
 *  with kernel is a single device, \a device can be a NULL value.
 *
 *  \param param_name specifies the information to query.
 *
 *  \param param_value is a pointer to memory where the appropriate result
 *  being queried is returned. If \a param_value is NULL, it is ignored.
 *
 *  \param param_value_size is used to specify the size in bytes of memory
 *  pointed to by \a param_value. This size must be >= size of return type.
 *
 *  \param param_value_size_ret returns the actual size in bytes of data copied
 *  to \a param_value. If \a param_value_size_ret is NULL, it is ignored.
 *
 *  \return One of the following values:
 *  - CL_SUCCESS if the function is executed successfully
 *  - CL_INVALID_VALUE if \a param_name is not valid, or if size in bytes
 *    specified by \a param_value_size is < size of return type and
 *    \a param_value is not NULL
 *  - CL_INVALID_KERNEL if \a kernel is a not a valid program object
